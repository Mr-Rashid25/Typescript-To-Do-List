To-Do List Command-Line Program in TypeScript.
This TypeScript program is a command-line to-do list manager. It allows users to interactively add,view and delete tasks to their to-do list until they choose to stop. The program uses the inquirer library and prompt sync to prompt the user for input and maintains a list of tasks that are displayed as they are added.
